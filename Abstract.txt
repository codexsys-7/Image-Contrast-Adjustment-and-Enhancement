Color Retinal image enhancement project deals with enhancing the quality of the image of an eye. So basically retinal imaging is a process of capturing retinal images of an eye which are very complicated and requires a lot of processing and sophisticated machines are used to capture those images. Now when we look at one of those images we might see that the images might be kind of little blur or brightness might be low or high. So here we have applied some techniques, such as contrast adjustment and increasing the luminosity of the images to enhance the quality of an eye which might help the doctors or professional working on this domain to get a clear view of the project/image they are looking for.
